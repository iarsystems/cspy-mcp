# <iar-path> is an IAR installation or build stage, i.e. the directory with
# common/bin under it. iaride is taken from <iar-path>/common/bin.
#
# Env vars:
#   IAR_INSTALL_PATH  the installation, if not given as an argument
#   IARIDE_EXE  override the iaride path
#   MCP_PORT    HTTP port to listen on (default 8000)
#
# IarIde hosts the IDE platform services - ProjectManager and OptionsService -
# so the project_* and options_* tools work against it. If you do not have an
# IDE to hand, run_headless.sh gets the same services from IarServiceLauncher
# without a GUI.
