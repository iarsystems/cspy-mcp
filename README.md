# cspy-mcp: MCP server for IAR C-SPY

[![CI](https://github.com/iarsystems/cspy-mcp/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iarsystems/cspy-mcp/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

An [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server, `iar-cspy-mcp`, that exposes
the IAR C-SPY debugger, and the Embedded Workbench project and option
services, to AI assistants (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, VS Code Copilot, ...)
as tools. It drives the backend over its Thrift interfaces, on a simulator or
real hardware.

The server is a thin layer over the [`iar-cspy`](https://github.com/iarsystems/cspy-py)
Python API: each tool parses its arguments, calls the API, and returns plain
JSON. For scripts and pytest hardware-in-the-loop tests, use that API
directly.

## Getting started

Install the server (it brings the `iar-cspy` API along) and point it at your
IAR installation, the directory with `common/bin` under it:

```sh
pip install "iar-cspy-mcp @ git+https://github.com/iarsystems/cspy-mcp"
iar-cspy-mcp --iar-path /opt/iar/ewarm       # or: python -m iar_cspy_mcp
```

To pin a version, add `@<branch, tag or commit>` after the repository URL.
Normally your MCP client starts the server for you; see below.

## Add it to your MCP client

All examples use managed mode: the server starts the backend itself from an
IAR installation or build stage (the directory with `common/bin` under it).
Adjust the path to your machine. See [Backend modes](#backend-modes)
for what managed and standalone mode do.

**Claude Code**: `.mcp.json` in your project (or `~/.claude.json`), or
`claude mcp add cspy-debugger -- iar-cspy-mcp --iar-path /opt/iar/ewarm`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cspy-debugger": {
      "command": "iar-cspy-mcp",
      "args": ["--iar-path", "/opt/iar/ewarm"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Desktop**: the same `mcpServers` block in `claude_desktop_config.json`
(Settings > Developer > Edit Config).

**VS Code Copilot**: `.vscode/mcp.json` (or `MCP: Add Server`):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "cspy-debugger": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "iar-cspy-mcp",
      "args": ["--iar-path", "C:\\iar\\ewarm-9.60"]
    }
  }
}
```

If `iar-cspy-mcp` is not on the client's `PATH`, use the virtualenv's Python:
`"command": "/abs/path/.venv/bin/python", "args": ["-m", "iar_cspy_mcp", ...]`.
From a checkout without installing, `run_headless.sh <iar-path>` does the same
over stdio (see [Helper scripts](#helper-scripts-linuxmacos)).

**An already-running backend** (standalone mode): replace `--iar-path` with
its service registry:

```json
"args": ["--registry-host", "127.0.0.1", "--registry-port", "51926"]
```

## Requirements

Python 3.10+ on Linux or Windows, and either an IAR installation or an
already-running backend to connect to. The installation is the directory with
`common/bin` under it (for example IAR Embedded Workbench for Arm), and it
needs to ship `CSpyServer2`; the backend is then started for you. The project
and options tools also need `IarServiceLauncher`.

## Backend modes

- **managed** (default): given an IAR installation (`--iar-path` or
  `IAR_INSTALL_PATH`), the server starts `IarServiceLauncher`, which owns the
  service registry and hosts the IDE services, and a `CSpyServer2` that joins
  that registry with `-registry <port>`, so the `project_*`/`options_*` tools
  work alongside the debugger ones. It supervises both and restarts them when
  they fail. CSpyServer2 supports one debug session per process, so every
  session gets a fresh one. Installations without the launcher, or
  `--no-ide-services`, run CSpyServer2 alone, without the project and options
  tools.
- **standalone**: `--registry-host`/`--registry-port` (or
  `THRIFT_REGISTRY_PORT`) connect to the registry of a backend someone else
  runs, such as a Thrift-enabled `iaride` or a hand-started
  CSpyServer2/IarServiceLauncher. The port is that of the service registry,
  not of the debugger service itself. Nothing is started or stopped.

See [docs/ide-services.md](docs/ide-services.md) for the IDE services, and
the [backend notes](https://github.com/iarsystems/cspy-py/blob/main/docs/backend-notes.md)
for known backend behavior.

### Command line

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--iar-path PATH` | IAR installation (managed mode). Normally the only option needed. |
| `--cspyserver2 PATH`, `--service-launcher PATH` | Individual program paths, overriding `--iar-path`. |
| `--cspyserver2-args ARGS` | CSpyServer2 arguments when it runs alone (default `-standalone -sockets`). |
| `--no-ide-services`, `--ide-services LIST` | Host no IDE services, or only `projectmanager`/`options`. |
| `--registry-host HOST`, `--registry-port PORT` | Connect to a running backend (standalone mode). |
| `--registry-service NAME` | Registry name of the debugger service (default `debugger`). |
| `--web`, `--web-port PORT` | Serve MCP over streamable HTTP at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp` (or `PORT`) instead of stdio. |
| `--probe-cspyserver2` | Start the managed backend, print its registry, exit. |

Every option also has an environment variable; see
[`.env.example`](.env.example). `MCP_TRANSPORT=streamable-http`,
`MCP_HOST` and `MCP_PORT` select the network transport without `--web`;
`MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0` listens on all interfaces, which exposes the debugger to
the network.

On stdio the server logs every backend RPC to stderr (`[thrift] call ...`),
which MCP hosts collect as server logs; stdout carries only the protocol.

### Helper scripts (Linux/macOS)

Bash wrappers that run the server from a checkout without installing it. Each
takes the IAR path as its first argument or from `IAR_INSTALL_PATH`, and uses
`.venv/bin/python3` when present.

| Script | Transport | Backend |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `run_headless.sh <iar-path>` | stdio | managed: IarServiceLauncher + CSpyServer2 |
| `run_web.sh <iar-path>` | HTTP on `MCP_PORT` | the same managed backend |
| `run_iaride.sh <iar-path>` | HTTP on `MCP_PORT` | standalone: starts IarIde and uses its registry |

`NO_IDE_SERVICES=1` and `THRIFT_IDE_SERVICES=projectmanager` restrict what
the managed backend hosts. On Windows, run `iar-cspy-mcp` (or
`python -m iar_cspy_mcp`) directly; `scripts/run_validation.ps1 -IarPath <path>`
runs the unit and live tests.

| Memory and code | `memory_read`, `memory_write_hex`, `disassembly_disassemble_range`, `sourcelookup_get_source_ranges` |
| Terminal I/O | `libsupport_get_output`, `libsupport_clear_output`, `libsupport_push_input`, `libsupport_wait_for_input_request`, `libsupport_request_input`, `libsupport_request_input_binary` |
| List windows | `listwindow_list_services`, `listwindow_get_overview`, `listwindow_get_rows`, `listwindow_sliding_navigate`, `listwindow_get_notifications`, `listwindow_trace_status`, `listwindow_trace_set_enabled`, `listwindow_trace_clear` |
| Projects | `project_load_workspace`, `project_status`, `project_get_files`, `project_build`, `project_get_launch_config`, `project_configure_and_start_debug` |
| Options | `options_create_session`, `options_get_category_tree`, `options_get_option_tree`, `options_update_state`, `options_commit`, `options_destroy_session` |
| IDE services | `ide_services_status`, `ide_services_ensure`, `ide_services_stop_launcher` |
| Discovery | `thrift_connection_info`, `debugger_list_methods`, `debugger_error_taxonomy` |
| Raw RPC | `debugger_call`, `projectmanager_call`, `options_call` |

Each tool's description (what the MCP client shows the model) documents its
arguments. The raw RPC tools take `args_json`: a JSON array for positional
arguments (`"[123, \"abc\"]"`), an object for keyword arguments, with
structs as objects and enums by name. Headless backends may not publish
instruction trace list windows; `listwindow_list_services("")` shows what is
registered before you read rows.

### Response envelope and errors

The lifecycle, status, wait, project and options tools return
`{"ok": bool, "tool": name, "data": {...}, "error": null | {...}}`. Expected
negative outcomes (a timeout, a failed build, rejected option values) are
`ok: false` with a machine-readable `error.code` (`TIMEOUT`, `BUILD_FAILED`,
`OPTION_VERIFICATION_FAILED`, ...) rather than a tool error.
`debugger_error_taxonomy()` lists the codes. When a failure looks like a
backend crash, `details.backend_diagnostics` carries the backend's recent
output.

Most debugger tools need a started session and refuse with an explicit
message otherwise.

## Playbooks

These are compact flows for tool-using agents.

**Start a session**: `debugger_configure_and_start_session(launch_json)`, then
`debugger_session_status()`; continue when `data.started` is true.
`launch_json` is one entry of a C-SPY VS Code `launch.json` (a whole file with
`configurations` also works: the first one is used). In managed mode every
call starts from a fresh backend process. The session runs to the
configuration's `stopOnSymbol`; `data.ranToSymbol` reports whether it got there.

**From an Embedded Workbench project**: `project_load_workspace(path)`, then
`project_build()` (a failed build is `ok: false` with `data.output_tail`),
then `project_configure_and_start_debug()`. No launch.json is needed.

**Run and wait**: `debugger_go_and_wait_for_core_state(desired_state=0, timeout_ms=5000)`.
Core states are 0 = stopped, 1 = running, 2 = sleeping, 3 = unknown, 4 = no power.
On `error.code == "TIMEOUT"`, retry with a longer timeout or call `debugger_stop()`.

**Breakpoints**: `breakpoints_set_on_source("/abs/path/main.c", 82)`,
`breakpoints_set_code("main", mode="hardware")`,
`breakpoints_set_data("g_state", 3)` (2/3/4 = read/write/read-write) and
`breakpoints_set_log("phase_step", "phase {g_phase}")` pick the breakpoint
category for the session's driver, so they also work on hardware probes;
`breakpoints_get_modes()` lists the driver's modes and `debugger_get_log()`
returns log breakpoint output. `breakpoints_set_on_ule("main", 1)` leaves
the category to the backend (1 = code, 2/3/4 watchpoints). ULEs are
expressions (`main`, `func+4`), addresses (`0x100`), or full-form source
locations (`{/abs/path/file.c}.123.1`); `main()` and `file.c:123` shorthand
are backend-dependent. `breakpoints_set_from_descriptor` only takes
descriptors returned by `breakpoints_get_all()`.

**Probe before advanced calls**: `debugger_capabilities()` returns the backend
mode, services, debugger methods, and any probe errors.

**Recover**: `debugger_strict_cleanup(reset_target=true)`, inspect
`data.errors[*].details.backend_diagnostics`, then start again.

**Non-intrusive attach**: use a launch configuration with `"request": "attach"`,
`"attachToTarget": true`, `"leaveTargetRunning": true` and all downloads
suppressed. Check `debugger_get_core_state` before deciding to call
`debugger_stop()`, and avoid `debugger_reset()`.

**Options**: `options_create_session` → `options_get_category_tree` →
`options_get_option_tree` → `options_update_state` → `options_commit` or
`options_destroy_session`; see [docs/ide-services.md](docs/ide-services.md#using-the-optionsservice-tools).
For plain option reading and writing, `projectmanager_call("GetOptionsForConfiguration", ...)`
needs no session.

**When a tool cannot do it**: for multi-step work such as loops, conditional
logic, or collecting a lot of state, writing a short script against the
[`iar_cspy` Python API](https://github.com/iarsystems/cspy-py) is often simpler and faster than many
tool calls. Its objects mirror these tools.

## How it works

```
 MCP client ──MCP──▶ iar-cspy-mcp ──▶ iar-cspy ──Thrift──▶ service registry ──▶ CSpyServer2  (debugger, breakpoints, memory, ...)
                                                                         └─▶ IarServiceLauncher (ProjectManager, OptionsService)
```

`iar-cspy` resolves every service through the registry, supervises the
managed processes, and hosts the callback services the backend expects from
a frontend (debug events, terminal I/O, list window notifications).

## Repository layout

```

## Development

```sh
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt                 # the server editable + pytest
pip install -e ../cspy-py                           # optional, afterwards: your checkout of iar-cspy
pytest                                              # unit tests; live tests skip without a backend
pytest -m live --cspy-iar-path=/opt/iar/ewarm       # live tests, managed backend
pytest -m live --cspy-cspyserver2=/path/CSpyServer2 # live tests, CSpyServer2 only
```

The tools live in `src/iar_cspy_mcp/tools/`, one module per area. Keep them
thin: argument parsing and result shaping belong here, behavior belongs in
`iar_cspy`. The tool tests run against `iar_cspy.testing.fake_client()`, and
`tests/test_live.py` covers a real backend on the bundled firmware
(`examples/firmware`), including a full MCP stdio round trip. CI
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the unit tests on Python 3.10-3.12, builds
the distribution, and runs the live tests against the public cxarm toolchain.

`python -m mcp_thrift_server`, the server's old name, still works from a
checkout (with a deprecation notice), so existing MCP client configs keep
working. Point them at `iar-cspy-mcp` / `python -m iar_cspy_mcp` instead.
